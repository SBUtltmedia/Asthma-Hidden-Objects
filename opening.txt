This trigger house contains some examples of things a person with asthma may be exposed to that may cause,  induce or trigger asthma symptoms. If some one is living with and constantly exposed to a substance that is an asthma trigger for them, it can be a cause of their asthma not being in good control, as well put them at higher risk for an exacerbation. Not all triggers are the same for all persons with asthma.

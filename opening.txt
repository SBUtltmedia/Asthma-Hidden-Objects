(NOTICE THIS INTRO TEXT ISN'T EDITABLE FROM HERE) Welcome to the (sometimes editable) trigger house - if you've accessed the site correctly you'll find there are now formatting controls in the area above this dialogue, and the text area here can now be typed into. Use the bold, italics and list formats to input your changes to this directly into the program; you can even change the style and font: then when you're done press the save icon. This trigger house contains some examples of things a person with asthma may be exposed to that may cause,  induce or trigger asthma symptoms. If some one is living with and constantly exposed to a substance that is an asthma trigger for them, it can be a cause of their asthma not being in good control, as well put them at higher risk for an exacerbation. Not all triggers are the same for all persons with asthma.

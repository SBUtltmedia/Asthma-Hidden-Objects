This is meant to be fun and interactive. Each room is an example of what may be found in a home. Each room is set up to have some examples of things a person with asthma may be exposed to each day in their home or other places. Triggers are of two types: Allergens -these are things that may cause allergy symptoms for a person with asthma, and Irritants-these are things that can irritate the airways and cause asthma to worsen. Triggers are things that can cause or &ldquo;trigger asthma symptoms for some people. The triggers can be in the air, on surfaces or within items. They can be breathed in and cause a reaction or problem in a person&rsquo;s nose, throat, and lungs that cause them to have asthma symptoms. If a person with asthma lives with triggers that cause asthma symptoms, this can also cause their asthma to be not well controlled. This can affect the person&rsquo;s ability to do normal activities, to not sleep well and can cause an asthma exacerbation also known as an Attack.<\/p>\n","Phase 2"],"Name":"Intro","yValue":10}]}

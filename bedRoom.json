Each room is set up to have some examples of things a person with asthma may be exposed to each day in their home or other places. Triggers are of two types: Allergens -these are things that may cause allergy symptoms for a person with asthma, and Irritants-these are things that can irritate the airways and cause asthma to worsen. Triggers are things that can cause or “trigger asthma symptoms for some people. The triggers can be in the air, on surfaces or within items. They can be breathed in and cause a reaction or problem in a person’s nose, throat, and lungs that cause them to have asthma symptoms. If a person with asthma lives with triggers that cause asthma symptoms, this can also cause their asthma to be not well controlled. This can affect the person’s ability to do normal activities, to not sleep well and can cause an asthma exacerbation also known as an Attack.",
